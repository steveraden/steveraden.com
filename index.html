                        Consulting has grounded me in the habit of considering the strategy or "Why?" of
                        what an project or task means to the organization no matter how technical that action may be.
                        It's also been invaluable to have exposed to the different problem solving styles of
                        contributors and workers, managers and leaders.

                    Especially challenging and rewarding is the work I've done for non-profit and grassroots
                    organizations both in the USA and abroad. Having far fewer resources than for-profit
                    enterprises really motivates an organization to be selective and judicious in their
                    technology choices. Consulting in this context can often involving empowering an
                    organization through knowledge transfer of emerging techniques and trends from the business
                    sector.

                I'm a senior developer whose worked on Python, Ruby on Rails and Node.JS SaaS projects and
                companies.
                In the past, I've been worked on some large .NET and Java code-bases, and also content
                management system hosted development such as Wordpress and Drupal.
                Though I've worked on the full stack, and pure front-end, the focus of my work has been on
                database programming, and SQL is my strongest language.

                My entry into the computer systems field was relational database technology. Many roles brought
                me adjacent to data services, analytics and database administration teams often because I was
                maintaining a data integration workflow which was non-performant and needed re-design around
                data engineering techniques. I'm training now on modern data engineering tool-sets such as
                Airflow, dbt and Google Cloud Platform Big Query.

                    I've acted as web master for several non-profit organizations, and then went on to build out
                    infrastructure on Amazon Web Services for several clients. Being able to translate between
                    engineers and other staff is key during a crisis, your learn a lot keeping the lights on a
                    system! However, the system's environment should really try to minimize heroism.

                I enjoy listening about what an organization does and translating that into feature
                specifications and database design. I also like understanding the general ecology of
                organization's applications and technical infrastructure. And also how all that interacts with
                the ecology of the organization itself; the appropriateness and sustainability of technology
                choices is a really important consideration.

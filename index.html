                        Consulting has grounded me in the habit of evaluating any proposed project or task against a variety of factors which can include technical debt, strategic and tactical relevance, and available resources. It's also exposed me to the different problem solving styles of contributors and workers, managers and leaders.

                        The work I've done for non-profit and grassroots organizations both in the USA and abroad has been especially challenging and rewarding.  The relative scarcity of resources that most non-profits face can cause an organization to be very selective in their technology choices. Consulting in this context often involves knowledge transfer of emerging technical trends from the business sector, and helping an the organization leverage these in a realistic and cost-effective way.

                        I'm a senior developer whose worked on Python, Ruby on Rails and Node.JS SaaS projects and companies. I've also worked on some large .NET, PHP and Java code-bases.  The focus of my work has been on database programming, but I've worked up and down the application stack.

                        My entry into the computer systems field was relational database technology. Many roles brought me adjacent to data services, analytics and database administration teams often because I was maintaining a data integration workflow which was non-performant and needed re-design around data engineering techniques. I'm training now on modern data engineering tool-sets such as Airflow, dbt and Google Cloud Platform Big Query.

                        I've been a web master for several non-profit organizations, and then went on to build out infrastructure on Amazon Web Services for several clients. Being able to translate between engineers and other staff is key during a crisis, and you learn a lot keeping the lights on a system! However, the system's environment should really try to minimize heroism.

                        I enjoy listening to what an organization does and translating that into feature specifications and database design. I also like understanding the general ecology of organization's applications and technical infrastructure. And also how all that interacts with the ecology of the organization itself; the appropriateness and sustainability of technology choices is a really important consideration.
